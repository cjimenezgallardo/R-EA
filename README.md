# R-EA

REA is Exploratory Data Analysis in R.
In this case, I created 2 scripts for my students in order to focus on analysis and not programming.

REA_descripY,
the script considers the analysis of the dependent variable according to an independent variable

REA_descripYxG


Shows:
ni = number of data per group,
mean, median, 
standard deviation,
skewness, kurtosis, 
some percentiles, IQR,
Maximum or minimum hinges, 

Boxplot and the density plot (histogram)
